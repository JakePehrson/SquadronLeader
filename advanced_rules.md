# Advanced Rules

These rules are for players already familiar with the core rules, or those who want to dive right in and become world famous fighter pilots!

## Altitude rule

The sky is a big place. Let's take advantage of that!

- At the start of the game each player takes off with 0 altitude tokens.
- Once per round during their move stage, a player may spend 1 speed to Climb and add 1 altitude token underneath their plane.
- Players can only gain 1 altitude per round.
- In a round that the player hasn't climbed, they may Dive by removing any number of altitude tokens to add that number to their speed for the round.
- When at a higher altitude while attacking or defending, a player may reroll 1 die.
- The maximum altitude allowed is 4.

## Split S rule

This rule prevents a pilot from being stuck when they are being tailed by an opponent.

- During the move phase, a player may declare they are executing a Split S maneuver and spend 3 altitude tokens to place their plane token at 180° at the end of the maneuver (facing the opposite direction to the way they were).
- The Speed cost of the maneuver is double the normal cost of whichever maneuver template the player is using (the straight now costs 2, the bank now costs 4).
- Players cannot perform a Split S and gain altitude in the same round.

You can read more about the Split S maneuver here:

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_S" target="_blank" class="button">Split S Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"To execute a split S, the pilot half-rolls their aircraft inverted and executes a descending half-loop, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude."

## Immelmann rule

This rule rewards aggressive tactics.

- After a player knocks an enemy plane out, they may gain 3 altitude tokens (or up to 3 if they already have 1, 2 or 3), execute a straight, and place their plane token at 180° at the end of the maneuver (facing the opposite direction to the way they were).
- This is an optional maneuver, but must be done before the next attack happens.

Here is an excerpt:

"In modern aerobatics, an Immelmann turn (also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver that results in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude."

Thanks to Ben for teaching me that this move has a name, and thanks Josh for finding Split S so that what the rules do in game match what real life planes can do!

## Barrel Roll rule

This rule seperates the timid from the bold!

- During the move phase a player may declare they are executing a Barrel Roll and execute either the 2 or 3 cost maneuver, but instead of orienting their plane along the new axis, their token will not rotate at all, and be traveling in the same direction.
- The speed cost for a Barrel roll is twice whatever number is on the template (2 maneuver costs 4, 3 maneuver costs 6)
- Players cannot perform a Barrel roll and gain altitude in the same round.

You can read more about the Barrel roll maneuver here:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_roll" target="_blank" class="button">Barrel Roll Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"A barrel roll is an aerial maneuver in which an airplane makes a complete rotation on both its longitudinal and lateral axes, causing it to follow a helical path, approximately maintaining its original direction."

## Ace Pilot rule

Earn your wings and keep the action moving!

- When a pilot destroys another plane, they become the Ace. (You can use the Medal token to remember who the current Ace is)
- For as long as they are the Ace, that pilot may reroll 1 Attack dice and 1 Defense dice each round.
- There can only be one Ace in the sky at a time.

## Using the Forward Firing Guides

Reward or challenge expert pilots by changing the rules around the firing arcs.
You can either:

- Play using only the forward firing guides and ignoring the wide arc, or
- Allow pilots to reroll an attack dice when the defender is in the forward firing guide.

# Alternative Play Mode

## Hex Grid Mode (for players without a 3D printer)

The game can be played on a hex grid. That removes the need for movement templates and rulers. All rules are the same as without a grid, except for what is described in this section.

Any battlemat with a hex grid can be used. Planes set up in hexes along each player's edge of the mat. There can only ever be one plane per hex, and planes can never end a move in the same hex as another plane. A plane always face one of the six sides of its hex.

Instead of using the movement templates there are three possible moves on a hex grid that are used instead:

- 1 (Cost 1) Move 2 hexes forward.
- 2 (Cost 2) Move 1 hex forward, then turn left or right 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward in the new direction.
- 3 (Cost 3) Turn 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward, then turn another 60 degrees in the same direction as the first turn

Attacks are up to range 3. Count range in hexes, not including the hex occupied by the attacking plane, but including the attacked plane. The firing arc of a plane is a cone in front of it, starting with the single hex in front, then the 3 hexes in front of that, then the 5 beyond those.

The hexes immediately in front of the firing plane corresponds to the closest section of the range ruler for the purpose of attack bonuses. Hexes at range 3 corresponds to the furthest section of the range ruler.
