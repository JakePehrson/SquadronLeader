# Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the STLs folder:

- plane.stl x1 for each player
- altitude.stl x4 for each player
- straight.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)
- bank.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)
- turn.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)

At 2mm layer height the number wheels can be printed no smaller than 85% or the charcaters don't print properly.
To adjust the tightness in the wheel, play around with "springWidth" variable around line 20 of the scad file.
Assemble to the stat wheel in the order ADSH (Attack, Defense, Speed, Health)

You will also need a piece of string more than 30cm long, and tie 2 knots 30cm apart for the range string.
