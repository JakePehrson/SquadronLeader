## Modular Rules

Squadron Leader has a growing set of modular rules to keep your games fresh, and for you to find the best version of aerial combat for you!

### Altitude rule

##### Recommended

This rules adds a lot of options for strategy, and it's recommended you play with it.

- At the start of the game each player takes off with 0 altitude tokens.
- Once per round during their move stage, a player may spend 1 speed to Climb and add 1 altitude token underneath their plane.
- Players can only gain 1 altitude per round.
- In a round that the player hasn't climbed, they may Dive by removing any number of altitude tokens to add that number to their speed for the round.
- When at a higher altitude while attacking or defending, a player may reroll 1 die.
- The maximum altitude allowed is 4.

### Split S rule

##### Recommended / Requires Altitude rule

This rule prevents a pilot from being stuck when they are being tailed by an opponent.

- During the move phase, a player may declare they are executing a Split S maneuver and spend 3 altitude tokens to place their plane token at 180° at the end of the maneuver (facing the opposite direction to the way they were).
- The Speed cost of the maneuver is double the normal cost of whichever maneuver template the player is using (the straight now costs 2, the bank now costs 4).
- Players cannot perform a Split S and gain altitude in the same round.

You can read more about the Split S maneuver here:

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_S" target="_blank" class="button">Split S Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"To execute a split S, the pilot half-rolls their aircraft inverted and executes a descending half-loop, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude."

### Immelmann rule

##### Requires Altitude rule

This rule rewards aggressive tactics:

- After a player knocks an enemy plane out, they may gain 3 altitude tokens (or up to 3 if they already have 1, 2 or 3), execute a straight, and place their plane token at 180° at the end of the maneuver (facing the opposite direction to the way they were).
- This is an optional maneuver, but must be done before the next attack happens.

You can read more about the Immelmann turn here:

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immelmann_turn" target="_blank" class="button">Immelmann Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"In modern aerobatics, an Immelmann turn (also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver that results in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude."

Thanks to Ben for teaching me that this move has a name, and thanks Josh for finding Split S so that what the rules do in game match what real life planes can do!

### Barrel Roll rule

This rule rewards expertly skills pilots who can maneuver their plane into just the right place in the sky!

- During the move phase a player may declare they are executing a Barrel Roll and execute either the 2 or 3 cost maneuver, but instead of orienting their plane along the new axis, their token will not rotate at all, and be traveling in the same direction.
- The speed cost for a Barrel roll is twice whatever number is on the template (2 maneuver costs 4, 3 maneuver costs 6)
- Players cannot perform a Barrel roll and gain altitude in the same round.

You can read more about the Barrel roll maneuver here:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_roll" target="_blank" class="button">Barrel Roll Wiki</a>

Here is an excerpt:

"A barrel roll is an aerial maneuver in which an airplane makes a complete rotation on both its longitudinal and lateral axes, causing it to follow a helical path, approximately maintaining its original direction."

### Ace Pilots rule

This rule rewards players for playing aggressively, which can be helpful if you find pilots often avoid the action.

- When a pilot knocks another pilot out of the sky they become an Ace, and gain a Ace Bonus die.
- For the rest of the game, that pilot can choose to roll the Ace Bonus die at any point, but only once a round.
- The player must declare they are rolling their Ace Bonus die before rolling any other dice.
- Players can have multiple Ace Bonus dice, if they knock multiple opponents out.

For example, you could say "I am rolling my bonus dice for this attack". You now can't use the bonus dice until the next round, so if you used it for your attack, you wouldn't be able to use it when defending this round.

If you have 2 Ace bonus, you could use them both in the same roll, or spread them out across the round.

### Using the Forward Firing Guides

Reward or challenge expert pilots by changing the rules around the firing arcs.
You can either:

- Play using only the forward firing guides and ignoring the wide arc, or
- Roll an additional attack dice when the defender is in the forward firing guide.

## Hex Grid Mode (for players without a 3D printer)

The game can be played on a hex grid. That removes the need for movement templates and rulers. All rules are the same as without a grid, except for what is described in this section.

Any battlemat with a hex grid can be used. Planes set up in hexes along each player's edge of the mat. There can only ever be one plane per hex, and planes can never end a move in the same hex as another plane. A plane always face one of the six sides of its hex.

Instead of using the movement templates there are three possible moves on a hex grid that are used instead:

- 1 (Cost 1) Move 2 hexes forward.
- 2 (Cost 2) Move 1 hex forward, then turn left or right 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward in the new direction.
- 3 (Cost 3) Turn 60 degrees, then move 1 hex forward, then turn another 60 degrees in the same direction as the first turn

![hex_moves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91621088/167960079-7a060dfd-bdcc-4787-87df-f362fb33d053.png)

Attacks are up to range 3. Count range in hexes, not including the hex occupied by the attacking plane, but including the attacked plane. The firing arc of a plane is a cone in front of it, starting with the single hex in front, then the 3 hexes in front of that, then the 5 beyond those.

The hexes immediately in front of the firing plane corresponds to the closest section of the range ruler for the purpose of attack bonuses. Hexes at range 3 corresponds to the furthest section of the range ruler.

## Game modes

### Team game

You can change the feel of the game greatly by flying with a wingman. The strategy of how you fly together is totally up to you. Here are the additional rules for playing in teams:

- Teammates should sit next to one another.
- The playing order is determined by teams, rather than players, so within your team you decide who moves first, and once the entire team has moved, the other team goes. This is the same principle for attacking.

### Quick game

There are a few ways to make the game shorter:

- Have everyone start with a max of 2 Health.
- Designate a smaller playing area.
- Allow players to gain more than 1 altitude per round.

Feel free to experiment with the starting numbers, the original 4,3,3,2 is a guideline for balanced games, so going higher will change the game, but so long as each player has the same choices it SHOULD be fair.
