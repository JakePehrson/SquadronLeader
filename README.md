Squadron Leader is a fast pace World War 1 (loosely) themed aerial combat game that is easy to learn and quick to play, with multifaceted strategy built in that can be enjoyed by all ages!

The modular nature of the rules allows for players to customise their game and add entirely new layers of strategy.

We encourage the use of house rules, and ask that you make suggestions on the <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, this is an Open Source game after all!

## Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the STLs directory:

#### For each player:

- player.stl
- stat_board.stl

#### To share either print:

- move_template.stl
- range_ruler.stl

#### Optional:

- box.stl x1
- FancyBoxTopper.stl x1 <b>and</b> FancyBoxTop.stl (FancyBoxTopper.stl is glued onto FancyBoxTop.stl. The topper is 'divided' into 5 levels to be able to perform filament swaps of different colors. The bottom level of the topper is .6mm giving 3, .2mm layer passes. All other levels are .4mm allowing 2, .2mm layer passes.

- If you are having a large dogfight and don't have enough different colour filaments, you can print the stat boards from the "extras" folder which have identifying letters".

## Downloads

You can download all the printable assets from GitHub. The reason we don't have anything on any of the STL sharing sites yet, is because things are in a big state of change, so its easer to just have them in one place at the moment.
