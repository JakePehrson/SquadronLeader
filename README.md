## Rules

Each aeronaut will need:

- 1 plane token
- 4 altitude tokens

The aeronauts will share:

- 1 of each move template
- 1 range string (with 2 knots 23cm apart)
- 4 Red d8 (Attack dice)
- 4 Green d8 (Defense dice)

At the start of the game each player secretly assigns the numbers 4,3,3,2 to their Attack, Defense, Speed & Health and simultaneously reveals their choices.

For example a begginner player may choose the following:

- Attack - 2
- Defense - 3
- Speed - 3
- Health - 4

Whereas a seasoned Ace may elect for:

- Attack - 3
- Defense - 3
- Speed - 4
- Health - 2

Determine who starts with a high roll of a d8.
Each player places their plane token in front of them in turn, and not closer than the range string to another players’ plane token that has already been placed. If each player is controlling more than one plane token, take in turns until each plane token is placed down.

### Move Stage:

- Players take turns to move their plane token using the move templates, up to their Speed value. Each move template has a cost of 1, 2 or 3, for the straight, bank & turn templates respectively.
- To move, place the template at the front of the plane token, and move the plane token to the other end of the template.
- The player may use templates up to the value of their speed, for example a plane token with a Speed of 4 can use move execute 2 straight maneuvers & 1 bank maneuver.
- A player must move at least
  once each turn otherwise their plane token will stall and they would plummet to the ground!

### Attack Stage:

- Players take turns to roll a number of Attack dice equal to your Attack value if the defender is within the forward guides. Half the Attack value (round down) if they are only within the wide arc. The defending player rolls a number of Defense equal to their Defense value.- Each value of 6-7 rolled on the Attack dice counts as 1 damage. An 8 rolled counts as a critical hit.
- Each value of 6-8 rolled on the Defense dice counts as a dodge and cancels out a hit. It takes 2 dodges to cancel out a critical hit.
- The defender loses Health equal to the hits that haven’t been canceled out.
- A player can only attack if the enemy plane token is in range. Range is determined with the knots on the range string and measuring from the front arc of the attackers plane token.

A new turn begins and the player who went second in the previous turn now goes first this turn.

### Altitude: (optional rule)

- At the start of the game each player takes off with 0 altitude tokens.
- Once per turn when a player moves, they may spend 1 speed to Climb and add 1 altitude token.
- On a turn they haven’t climbed, players may Dive by removing any number of altitude tokens to add that number to their speed for the turn.
  Beware the enemy in the sun! When rolling dice for the attack step, if the attacker is at a higher altitude they roll an additional die.

### Immelman Turn:

Any turn a player hasn’t executed a climb or dive may spend 3 altitude tokens to place their plane token 180° (facing backwards) after a manuever. The Speed cost of the maneuver is doubled (the straight becomes a 2 etc)

Alright Aeronauts, let’s fly!

## Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the STLs folder:

- plane.stl x1 for each player
- altitude.stl x4 for each player
- straight.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)
- bank.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)
- turn.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)

You will also need a piece of string more than the length of 3 of the 1 cost manuever template. Tie knots this distance apart for your range ruler.
