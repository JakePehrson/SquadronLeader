![gameplay](https://squadronleader.netlify.app/static/media/gameplay.e60266eabf4ea8ab23f6.jpg)

Squadron Leader is a fast pace World War 1 (loosely) themed aerial combat game that is easy to learn and quick to play, with multifaceted strategy built in that can be enjoyed by all ages!

## Rules

Each pilot will need:

- 1 plane token
- 4 altitude tokens

The pilots will share:

- 1 of each move template
- 1 range string
- 3-4 Red d8 (Attack dice)
- 4 Green d8 (Defense dice)
- 1-2 Blue d8 (Bonus dice)

At the start of the game each player secretly assigns the numbers 4,3,3,2 to their Attack, Defense, Speed & Health and simultaneously reveals their choices.

For example a begginner player may choose the following:

- Attack - 2
- Defense - 3
- Speed - 3
- Health - 4

Whereas a seasoned Ace may elect for:

- Attack - 3
- Defense - 3
- Speed - 4
- Health - 2

Determine who starts with a high roll of a d8.
Each player places their plane token in front of them in turn, and not closer than the range string to another players’ plane token that has already been placed. If each player is controlling more than one plane token, take in turns until each plane token is placed down.

### Move Stage:

- Players take turns to move their plane token using the move templates, up to their Speed value. Each move template has a cost of 1, 2 or 3, for the straight, bank & turn templates respectively.
- To move, place the template at the front of the plane token, and move the plane token to the other end of the template.
- The player may use templates up to the value of their speed, for example a plane token with a Speed of 4 can execute 2 straight maneuvers & 1 bank maneuver (1+1+2).
- A player must move at least once each turn otherwise their plane token will stall and they would plummet to the ground!
- If any part of a plane token goes off the board at the end of a maneuver, that plane is destroyed!

### Attack Stage:

- The attacking player rolls a number of Attack dice equal to your Attack value.
- The defending player rolls a number of Defense dice equal to their Defense value.
- Each value of 6-7 rolled on the Attack dice counts as 1 damage. An 8 rolled counts as a critical hit.
- Each value of 6-8 rolled on the Defense dice counts as a dodge and cancels out a hit. It takes 2 dodges to cancel out a critical hit. Critical hits still only deal 1 damage when not cancelled out.
- The defender loses Health equal to the hits that haven’t been canceled out.
- A player can only attack if the enemy plane token is in range. Range is determined with the knots on the range string, ensuring any part of the knots each crosses over a token, or closer. 
- The defender must also be within the attackers firing arc (90° lines on the front of the token).

A new turn begins and the player who went second in the previous turn now goes first this turn.

Alright enough chatter, let's take to the skies!
## Optional Rules

### Altitude (recommended)

This rules adds a lot of options for strategy, and it's recommended you play with it.

- At the start of the game each player takes off with 0 altitude tokens.
- Once per turn when a player moves, they may spend 1 speed to Climb and add 1 altitude token underneath their plane.
- On a turn they haven’t climbed, players may Dive by removing any number of altitude tokens to add that number to their speed for the turn.
- When at a higher altitude than an attacker or defender, you may reroll 1 dice.

### Immelmann Turn rule (recommended)

##### Requires Altitude

This rule prevents a pilot from being stuck when they are being tailed by an opponent.
Any turn a player hasn’t executed a climb or dive may spend 3 altitude tokens to place their plane token 180° (facing backwards) after a manuever. The Speed cost of the maneuver is doubled (the straight becomes a 2 etc)

You can read more about the Immelmann turn here.

[Immelmann Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immelmann_turn)

Here is an excerpt:

"In modern aerobatics, an Immelmann turn (also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver that results in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude."

Thanks to Ben for teaching me that this move has a name!
### Ace Pilots rule

This rule rewards players for playing aggressively, which can be helpful if you find pilots often avoid the action.

- When a pilot knocks another pilot out of the sky, they gain a bonus dice.
- For the rest of the game, that pilot can choose to roll the bonus dice at any point, but only once a round.
- You must declare you are rolling your bonus before rolling any other dice.

For example, you could say "I am rolling my bonus dice for this attack". You can't use the bonus dice until the next round, so if you used it for your attack, you wouldn't be able to use it when defending this round.

### Using the Forward Firing Guides

If you are an expert pilot, you can make the game harder for yourself!

You can either:

- Play using only the forward firing guides and not the wide arc, or
- Roll an additional attack dice when the defender is in the forward firing guide.

### Team rules

You can change the feel of the game greatly by flying with a wingman. The strategy of how you fly together is totally up to you. Here are the additional rules for playing in teams:

- Teammates should sit next to one another
- The turn order is determined by teams, rather than players, so within your team you decide who moves first, and once the entire team has moved, the other team goes. This is the same principle for attacking.

### Quick game rules

For shorter games, have everyone start with Health 2, Attack 3, Speed 4 and Defense 2.
The playing area size also effects game time, so if you make the area smaller, you will have a much faster game.
Feel free to experiment with these number, the original 4,3,3,2 is a guideline for balanced games only.

## Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the STLs folder:

- plane.stl x1 for each player
- altitude.stl x4 for each player
- straight.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)
- bank.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)
- turn.stl x1 (or 1x for each player if you wish)

You will also need a piece of string more than the length of 3 of the 1 cost manuever template. Tie knots this distance apart for your range ruler.

## Downloads

You can download all the printable assets from GitHub. The reason we don't have anything on any of the STL sharing sites yet, is because things are in a big state of change, so its easer to just have them in one place at the moment.

You fit the game in most tobacco tins, old or new, but if you'd like a Squadron Leader tin that isn't £100+, you can get one here.
