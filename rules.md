# Rules

The objective of the game is to be the last plane left in the air by reducing your opponents Health to zero.

Each pilot will need:

- 1 plane token
- 4 altitude tokens

The pilots will share:

- 1 move template
- 1 range ruler
- 4 Red d6 for the Attack dice
- 4 Green d6 for the Defense dice
- Optional: Blue d6 for the Ace Bonus dice
- Optional: 1 70cm x 70cm playmat

The playing area of the game can be any size. Its usually just the entire table, because that is the easiest to keep track of, but for an optimal playing experience, you can define a square which is 70 cm square or 3 lengths of the range ruler wide and long.

At the start of the game each player secretly assigns the numbers 4,3,3,2 to their Attack, Defense, Speed & Health and simultaneously reveals their choices.

For example a beginner player may choose the following:

- Attack - 2
- Defense - 3
- Speed - 3
- Health - 4

Whereas a seasoned Ace may elect for:

- Attack - 3
- Defense - 3
- Speed - 4
- Health - 2

Determine who starts with a high roll of a d6.
Each player places their plane within 1 straight maneuver template from the edge of the playing area and not closer than the range ruler to another players’ token that has already been placed. If players are controlling more than one plane, take it in turns until each token is placed down.

There are 2 stages each round, the Move Stage and the Attack Stage. Everyone moves during the Move stage, and then everyone Attacks during the Attack Stage. Here are how they work:

## Move Stage:

- Players take turns to move their plane using the move templates, up to their Speed value. Each move template has a cost of 1, 2 or 3 for the straight, bank & turn templates respectively.
- To move, place the maneuver template at the front of the plane token, and move the plane to the other end of the template.
- The player may use templates up to the value of their speed, for example a player with a Speed of 4 can execute 2 straight maneuvers & 1 bank maneuver (1 + 1 + 2).
- A player must move at least once each round otherwise their plane would stall and they would plummet to the ground!
- If any part of a plane token goes off the board at the end of a maneuver, that plane is destroyed!

The below gif shows how to use the maneuver templates.

## Attack Stage:

- The attacker declares which enemy plane they will attack.
- A player can only attack if the enemy plane is within in range. Range is determined with the two endmost marks on the range ruler, ensuring both planes are within that distance.
- The defender must also be within the attackers firing arc which is the 90° lines on the front of the token.
- The attacking player rolls a number of Attack dice equal to their Attack value.
- The defending player rolls a number of Defense dice equal to their Defense value.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Attack dice counts as 1 damage. A 6 rolled counts as a critical hit.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Defense dice counts as a dodge and cancels out a hit. It takes 2 dodges to cancel out a critical hit. Critical hits still only deal 1 damage when not cancelled out.
- The defender loses Health equal to the hits that haven’t been canceled out.

### Attack/Defense bonuses

Beyond the bonuses outlined in the altitude rule, there are 2 other attack and defense bonuses dependent on the distance between the attacker and defender:

- The defender may reroll 1 die if they are within the furthest section of the range ruler
- The attacker may reroll 1 dice if they are within the closest section of the range ruler

This adds a nice dynamic between (1) rewarding players for an aggressive assault (2) rewarding defenders for making a getaway (3) punishing those people getting away by not rewarding a bonus to their roll.

## Next Round:

After the final attack, a new round begins and the player who went second in the previous round now goes first.

Alright enough chatter, let's take to the skies!

## Alternative Game modes

### Team game

You can change the feel of the game greatly by flying with a wingman. The strategy of how you fly together is totally up to you. Here are the additional rules for playing in teams:

- Teammates should sit next to one another.
- The playing order is determined by teams, rather than players, so within your team you decide who moves first, and once the entire team has moved, the other team goes. This is the same principle for attacking.

### Quick game

There are a few ways to make the game shorter:

- Have everyone start with a max of 2 Health.
- Designate a smaller playing area.
- Allow players to gain more than 1 altitude per round.

Feel free to experiment with the starting numbers, the original 4,3,3,2 is a guideline for balanced games, so going higher will change the game, but so long as each player has the same choices it SHOULD be fair.
