# Rules

The objective of the game is to be the last plane left in the air by reducing your opponents Health to zero.

Each pilot will need:

- 1 plane token
- 4 altitude tokens

The pilots will share:

- 1 move template
- 1 range ruler
- 4 Red d6 for the Attack dice
- 4 Green d6 for the Defense dice
- Optional: Blue d6 for the Ace Bonus dice
- Optional: 1 70cm x 70cm playmat

The playing area of the game can be any size. Its usually just the entire table but if you want to have a consistent size try 3 lengths of the range ruler.

At the start of the game each player assigns their choice from 4, 3, 3, 2 to their:

- Health
- Defense
- Attack
- Maneuverability

A good starting setup for new players is:

- Health - 3
- Defense - 3
- Attack - 2
- Maneuverability - 4

The last player to see a plane goes first.

Each player places their plane in front of them in turn.
It should be placed within range 1 of the edge of the table, and not closer than a ranger ruler to another player.

There are 2 stages each round, the maneuver Stage and the Attack Stage.
Everyone moves their plane during the maneuver stage, and then everyone Attacks during the Attack Stage. Here is how that works:

## Maneuver Stage:

- Players take turns to move their plane using the maneuver templates, up to their Maneuverability value. Each maneuver template has a cost of 1, 2 or 3 for the straight, bank & turn templates respectively.
- To move, place the maneuver template at the front of the plane token, and move the plane to the other end of the template.
- The player may use templates up to the value of their Maneuverability, for example a player with a Maneuverability of 4 can execute 2 straight maneuvers & 1 bank maneuver (1 + 1 + 2).
- A player must complete at least one maneuver each round otherwise their plane would stall and they would plummet to the ground! (Gaining altitude doesn't count)
- If any part of a plane token goes off the board at the end of a maneuver, that plane is destroyed!

The below gif shows how to use the maneuver templates.

## Attack Stage:

- The attacker declares which enemy plane they will attack.
- A player can only attack if the enemy plane is within in range. Range is determined with the two endmost marks on the range ruler, ensuring both planes are within that distance.
- The defender must also be within the attackers firing arc which is the 90° lines on the front of the token.
- The attacking player rolls a number of Attack dice equal to their Attack value.
- The defending player rolls a number of Defense dice equal to their Defense value.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Attack dice counts as 1 damage. A 6 rolled counts as a critical hit.
- Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Defense dice counts as a dodge and cancels out a hit. It takes 2 dodges to cancel out a critical hit. Critical hits still only deal 1 damage when not cancelled out.
- The defender loses Health equal to the hits that haven’t been canceled out.

### Attack/Defense bonuses

Beyond the bonuses outlined in the modular altitude rule, there are 2 other attack and defense bonuses dependent on the distance between the attacker and defender:

- The defender may reroll 1 die if they are within the furthest section of the range ruler
- The attacker may reroll 1 dice if they are within the closest section of the range ruler

This adds a nice dynamic between:

- rewarding players for an aggressive assault
- rewarding defenders for making a getaway

## Next Round:

After the last player who can attacks does so, a new round begins and the player who went second in the previous round now goes first.

Alright enough chatter, let's take to the skies!
