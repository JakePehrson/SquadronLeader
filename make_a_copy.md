# Getting a Copy of the Game

At the moment the only way to get a copy of this game is to make it yourself, or find a friend with a 3D printer who is willing to print it for you. In the future there may be a way to order them, or even a crowd funding thing... who knows!

## Printing instructions

You will need to print the following from the <a href="https://github.com/Wollivan/SquadronLeader/tree/main/PrintingAssets/3D%20Printing/STLs" target="_blank">STLs</a> directory:

### For each player:

- player.stl
- stat_board.stl

### To share either print:

- move_template.stl
- range_ruler.stl

### Optional from the extras directory:

- box.stl x1
- FancyBoxTopper.stl x1 <b>and</b> FancyBoxTop.stl (FancyBoxTopper.stl is glued onto FancyBoxTop.stl. The topper is 'divided' into 5 levels to be able to perform filament swaps of different colors. The bottom level of the topper is .6mm giving 3, .2mm layer passes. All other levels are .4mm allowing 2, .2mm layer passes.

- If you are having a large dogfight and don't have enough different colour filaments, you can print the stat boards from the "extras" folder which have identifying letters".

## Downloads

You can download all the printable assets from GitHub. The reason we don't have anything on any of the STL sharing sites yet, is because things are in a big state of change, so its easer to just have them in one place at the moment.
